#### Automatically responds to item price check messages using pricing information from your TradeSkillMaster and/or BootyBayGazette auction databases.
You must have at least one of them installed for this addon to work.

##### Usage
This addon listens to whispers, guild chat, officer chat, party chat, and raid chat for messages containing `!price` and one or more item links.

The response includes the market value and last seen minimum buyout of the item(s) determined by TradeSkillMaster for your realm and region (via the TSM helper application) when available, and the market value with standard deviation for your realm and region determined by BootyBayGazette when available.

You must manually scan with TradeSkillMaster and keep the BootyBayGazette addon up to date to maintain accurate pricing info.
